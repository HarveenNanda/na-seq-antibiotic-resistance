# RNA-Seq Analysis of Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria

This project analyzes RNA-Seq data from *E. coli* strains exposed to antibiotics to identify differentially expressed antimicrobial resistance genes using R and DESeq2.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- R, DESeq2
- NCBI GEO Dataset: [GSE9006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE9006)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `scripts/`: R code used for analysis
- `data/`: Metadata file (sample info)
- `results/`: Plots and result tables

## ðŸ“Œ Steps
1. Imported count data and sample metadata
2. Performed differential expression analysis using DESeq2
3. Visualized results (volcano plot, heatmap)

## ðŸ“Š Output
Key resistance genes were identified and visualized. This project demonstrates RNA-Seq pipeline skills with real-world data.
