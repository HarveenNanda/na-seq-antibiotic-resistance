# RNA-Seq Analysis of Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria

This project analyzes RNA-Seq data from *E. coli* exposed to antibiotics using DESeq2 in R.

## Tools Used
- R, DESeq2
- NCBI GEO dataset: GSEXXXXX

## Key Steps
- Data import and QC
- Differential gene expression analysis
- Visualization: Volcano plot, heatmap

## Results
Key genes upregulated in resistant strains were identified and visualized.
