# RNA-Seq Analysis of Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria

This project analyzes RNA-Seq data from *E. coli* strains exposed to antibiotics. Differentially expressed resistance genes were identified using R and DESeq2.

## Tools Used
- R, DESeq2
- Public Dataset (example): NCBI GEO - GSE9006

## Steps
1. Load count data and sample metadata
2. Run differential expression analysis using DESeq2
3. Visualize results using volcano plot and heatmap

## Results
- `deseq2_results.csv`: Table of differentially expressed genes
- `volcano_plot.png`: Visualizes most significant genes
- `heatmap.png`: Compares expression across samples

## Skills Demonstrated
- RNA-Seq, Bioinformatics, R Programming, Data Visualization
